### Organization
#### Overall layout
Associated code and files for different procedures are separated into distinct directories, outlined below. Each level of organization also contains a separate `README.md` file that better details what can be found. 

#### Manifest:
- `files`: all associated files for complete reproduction of the work
- `scripts`: all code necessary for analysis
- `figures`: directory containing unedited image files for all figures in the main text and supporting information

### Requirements
The content here relies primarily on open-source tools and we provide files to reproduce the environment we used to run the analyses. Some materials require an OpenEye license, which is free for academics.
